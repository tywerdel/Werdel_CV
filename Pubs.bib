	abstract = {Ungulate species have consistently been a major focus of reintroductions to their native ranges. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are an ecologically sensitive species, and have experienced population declines throughout their historic range; bighorn sheep inhabited the Black Hills region of South Dakota but were extirpated from the area due to anthropogenic impacts in the early 1900s. To continue to restore populations to the area, we translocated 26 bighorn sheep from Alberta, Canada to the Deadwood Region of the Black Hills. Bighorn sheep were fitted with {VHF} or {GPS} collars and monitored throughout the duration of the study (Feb 2015–Jan 2017). Our objectives were to evaluate movement patterns post-release of bighorn sheep in the translocated Deadwood bighorn sheep herd. We utilized 3 types of home-range analyses based on collar data; kernel density estimation ({KDE}), minimum convex polygon ({MCP}), and Brownian Bridge Movement Models ({BBMM}) were used to estimate home-ranges year 1, year 2, and for the duration of the study. Home-range size utilizing {KDE} (95\%; \$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 41.41 km2, {SE} = 10.50), minimum convex polygon (95\%; \$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 55.73 km2, {SE} = 15.04), and {BBMM} (95\%; \$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 32.95 km2, {SE} = 4.67) differed among methods. Year 1 home-range sizes (95\% {BBMM}; \$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 40.01 km2) were larger than year 2 (95\% {BBMM}; \$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 4.08 km2) home-range sizes. Travel distances were also larger in year 1 (\$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 431.80 km) than year 2 (\$\${\textbackslash}overline\{x\}\$\$ = 368.77 km). Our results indicate that after an acclimation period, which included individual dispersal, the translocated Deadwood bighorn sheep herd settled into smaller home-ranges near the release site.},

	abstract = {Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) were once extirpated from the Black Hills region of South Dakota, U.S.A., mirroring declining populations throughout North America. Since the 1960s, several reintroductions have occurred in the Black Hills to reestablish populations, with varying success. We translocated 26 bighorn sheep from Alberta, Canada, to the Black Hills (February 2015) to restore bighorn sheep to their historic range. Due to prior examinations of cause-specific survival, subsequent genetic diversity and disease prevalence analyses were required to evaluate success of the restoration effort. We measured a mean allelic diversity of 5.23 ({SE} = 0.44 [mean number of alleles]) and an observed heterozygosity of 0.71 ({SE} = 0.06; expected = 0.64 ± 0.05) in the translocated individuals. Translocated bighorn sheep tested negative for Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae at capture. An autogenous vaccine was administered prior to release in an attempt to safeguard the translocated bighorn sheep from infection with a strain known to be resident in adjacent bighorn sheep populations. However, the year following the translocation, a different strain of M. ovipneumoniae was associated with a pneumonia outbreak that resulted in 57.9\% mortality. Our results suggest that allelic diversity and heterozygosity were sufficient for long-term herd establishment, reducing the potential for founder effects. However, the overwhelming mortality associated with pneumonia, via the transfer of M. ovipneumoniae from an unknown source, limited the success or our reintroduction efforts. Successful attempts to restore bighorn sheep to their historic ranges must consider and mitigate potential routes for M. ovipneumoniae transmission pre- and post-reintroduction.},

	abstract = {Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) historically inhabited the Black Hills region of South Dakota, but the species was extirpated from the area in the early 1900s concurrent with declines in population throughout their entire North American range. Translocation is a common management tool allowing for accelerated colonization of historic Bighorn Sheep habitat, but many attempts are unsuccessful. Mountain Lions (Puma concolor) and pneumonia are generally considered the most common limiting factors to Bighorn Sheep populations. Twenty-six Bighorn Sheep were translocated from Alberta, Canada to the Deadwood region of the northern Black Hills, an area with both a resident Mountain Lion population and potential for contact with Domestic Sheep (Ovis aries) and Goats (Capra hircus), known carriers of pathogens that are lethal to Bighorn Sheep. Adult survival and natality increased the population substantially in year 1, however, the only breedingage male was euthanized owing to concerns about potential for pathogen transmission from Domestic Sheep and Goats. In year 2, the population experienced a pneumonia outbreak, resulting in 57.9\% of all mortalities during the study period. Mountain Lion predation was not detected, nor was direct contact with Domestic Sheep or Goats observed. Intensive monitoring was critical in determining the outcome of the translocation.},
