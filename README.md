![CV](https://github.com/tywerdel/Werdel_CV/blob/main/CVHeader.png?raw=true)

This is my academic CV.

Created in R Markdown. I started with the [Hyndmand Template](https://github.com/robjhyndman/CV) in R Markdown, but made many significant changes, by adding .tex code from [Rainsworth](https://github.com/rainsworth/awesomeCV) to have descending publication lists. I formatted fonts to integrate with the original template and then increased font size throughout the document. I also changed the "awesome"" color to match Texas A&M's html color code.

Feel free to use any of the files to create your own CV from the repository.
